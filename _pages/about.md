Hello! Iâ€™m Martina Di Paola, a 4th-year student at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), originally from Italy. I am majoring in Computer Science with a double major in Business Technology and Management. I have also been an Undergraduate Researcher at [CSTL](https://cstlab.org) under the supervision of Professor [Joseph Seering](https://joseph.seering.org/index.html).

Over the past two years, my research has focused on social media and content moderation. As an avid social media user myself, I am dedicated to enhancing moderation practices and improving the overall user experience on social media, from both user and designer perspectives.

Feel free to follow me on social media to stay in touch!
