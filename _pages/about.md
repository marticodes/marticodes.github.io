Hello! I am Martina Di Paola, a 4th-year student at KAIST(Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), originally from Italy. I am majoring in Computer Science with a double major in Business Technology and Management. I have been an Undergraduate Researcher at CSTL user the supervision of Professor Joseph Seering. 

In my two years as researcher my focus has been on Social Media and Content Moderation. As an avid social media user myself, I aim to improve moderation practices and overall experience on social media, from both the user and designer side. 

Given this, follow me on social media if you want to keep in touch!
